I would first like to thank my thesis advisor, professor Weichung Wang. His lab provides rich learning resources and precious opportunities. He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right the direction whenever I have difficulties in research. 

I would also like to thank the doctors at National Taiwan University Hospital who were involved in the pancreatic project: Dr. Wei-Chih Liao and Dr. Poting Chen. Without their medical professionalism and advice on research method, the research could not have been successfully conducted. 

I'm glad to thank a excellent research assistant Tinghui Wu of the Academia Sinica as the second reader of this thesis, and I am gratefully indebted to her for her very valuable comments on this thesis. She also kindly helped me for both programming and experiment setting. 

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my friends Chunshuo Chen and YuYuan Yuan. At the end of the second semester of master degree, I was stranded at a bottleneck of my research. They provided me with practical support and encouragement throughout my dilemma and through the process of researching and writing this thesis.  This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
