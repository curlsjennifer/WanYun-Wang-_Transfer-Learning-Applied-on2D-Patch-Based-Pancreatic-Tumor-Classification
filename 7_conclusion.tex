\section{Limitations} 
((Study limitations, including potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalizability)) \\
Since the target data is composed of two dataset: MSD dataset and TCIA dataset, the distribution of two datasets might be different, so the model performance may decrease because of the reason. Also, since the number of data is not large enough, the outliers shows up in cross validation experiments. 

\section{Implications for practice*}
((Implications for practice, including the intended use and/or clinical role)) \\

\section{Future Work?}
We can try different fine-tuning details of AIFT method. It's possible to increase the performance on target data.
